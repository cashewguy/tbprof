  Hi, my name's Thomas, and I work in social services while I pursue my master's degree in Social Work.  Currently, I'm the Continuum of Care Coordinator for the Champaign County Continuum of Service Providers to the Homeless, where I work to coordinate our responsibilities as the US Department of Housing and Urban Development's Continuum of Care for Champaign County.

  Of the many aspects of my job that I enjoy, the things I enjoy most are <mark>policy advocacy</mark>, <mark>grant work</mark>, and <mark>coordinating multi-agency strategic efforts</mark>.

            I provided support, facilitation, and direction to the Champaign County Continuum of Service Providers for the Homeless (CSPH), which is the Housing & Urban Development (HUD) Continuum of Care (CoC) for Champaign County.  Some of my responsibilities include:
            - Coordination of multiple rapid-response groups during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the local deployment of Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS) Emergency Lodging Funds and the CARES Act allocation of the Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG)
            - Lead completion of the HUD CoC Program Competition Consolidated Application (also called "the NOFA"), while supporting the local competition for those Funds
            - Management of all responsibilities of the annual Point-in-Time and Housing Inventory Counts
            - Building relationships with all Continuum members and growing our membership
            - Ensuring the Continuum's compliance with the Homeless Emergency Assistance & Rapid Transition to Housing Act (HEARTH) regulations
            - Preparing and submitting the IL-503 Emergency Solutions Grants application to the IDHS, while liaising with IDHS for those programs

          I joined the RPC team as a case manager in their No Limits Self Sufficiency program, while also coordinating the temporary hardship rent assistance program.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            As a case manager, my work focused on clients served through the Community Service Block Grant (CSBG), the Emergency Shelter for Families, and Rapid Re-Housing.  I was also tasked with re-developing the Homeless Prevention program, which was funded by the IDHS Homeless Prevention grant, and providing case management services to some of those clients.  Some of my responsibilities included:
            - Collaborating with clients to identify realistic, timely, and achievable goals
            - Conducting weekly home visits
            - Case managing clients in the Emergency Shelter for Families, Maple Grove, Rapid Re-Housing, and No Limits programs
            - Assessing clients' levels of self-sofficiency, strengths, and barriers
            - Assisting with walk-in assessments for Centralized Intake for Homeless
            - It was particularly meaningful to me to work with Chicago Coalition of the Homeless on their Homeless Prevention Coalition, specifically on <a href='https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=3331&GAID=15&DocTypeID=HB&LegID=119833&SessionID=108&SpecSess=&Session=&GA=101'>Illinois House Bill 3331</a>, which significantly strengthened the IDHS Homeless Prevention Program
